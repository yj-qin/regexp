# RegExp
[![check](https://github.com/yj-qin/regexp/actions/workflows/check.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/yj-qin/regexp/actions/workflows/check.yml)

A regular expression module based on a backtracking engine. Due to backtracking during matching, some regular expressions will run for a long time under specific inputs, also known as catastrophic backtracking.
The design of the bytecode and interpreter was heavily inspired by the .NET regular expression library.

## Usage

```moonbit
test "basic" {
  let regexp = @regexp.compile!(
    "^(?<addr>[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+)@(?<host>[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,})$",
  )
  let match_result = regexp.matches("12345@test.com")
  @json.inspect!(match_result.success(), content=true)
  @json.inspect!(match_result.captures(), content=[
    "12345@test.com", "12345", "test.com",
  ])
  @json.inspect!(match_result.named_captures(), content={
    "addr": "12345",
    "host": "test.com",
  })
}
```
